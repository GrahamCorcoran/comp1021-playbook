# JavaScript and Runtimes

In this course we will be using JavaScript heavily, and while doing so we need to understand the difference between JavaScript the programming language, a JavaScript runtime, and the tools we use surrounding these concepts. 

## JavaScript
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is a programming language that was created to further expand the functionality of HTML and CSS in a web context.

## Runtimes
A JavaScript *runtime* (or engine) is the process that executes the JavaScript code, and handles the result. 

### Node
### Web Browsers

#### HTML DOM

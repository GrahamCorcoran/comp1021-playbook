# Module 1: Client & Server-side Scripting

This module covers JavaScript and the two main environments where it runs: the server (using Node.js) and the browser.

We start with the JavaScript language itself, covering variables, data types, operators, and functions. From there, we move into Node.js, JavaScript runtimes, and then into HTML, the DOM, and how JavaScript interacts with web pages in the browser.

## Client-side and Server-side

In web development, **client-side** refers to code that runs in the user's browser. When someone visits a web page, the browser downloads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and runs it locally on their machine. This is the client.

**Server-side** refers to code that runs on a remote machine (the server) before anything is sent to the browser. The server handles things like processing data, connecting to databases, and deciding what content to send back to the client.

JavaScript is one of the few languages used on both sides. In this module, we cover both.

By the end of this module, you should be comfortable writing JavaScript, running it in both Node.js and the browser, and understanding the distinction between the two environments.

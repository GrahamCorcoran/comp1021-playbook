# COMP 205: Web Development

COMP 205 (Web Development) and COMP 1021 (Web Programming) are co-requisites. The two courses are designed to complement each other, and the material in each supports the other.

COMP 205 focuses on HTML, CSS, the visual structure of the web page, and front-end development. COMP 1021 focuses on server-side programming, and building dynamic web applications. 

The COMP 205 Playbook is available at [comp205.grahamcorcoran.ca](https://comp205.grahamcorcoran.ca). You may be referred to it throughout this course when topics overlap, particularly around HTML and CSS.
